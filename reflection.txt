Using branches is powerful because it lets each team member work on a new feature or fix in isolation without changing the main branch. This makes collaboration safer since the main branch can stay stable while unfinished or experimental work happens in separate branches. Each branch also keeps a clear history of what changes were made and why, which makes reviewing and debugging easier.
Branches prevent problems like accidentally breaking working code for everyone, overwriting each other’s changes, or mixing multiple features into one messy commit. They also support code reviews and testing before merging, so teams can catch bugs early and resolve conflicts in a controlled way rather than discovering issues after the code is already in production.
